# Just Syntax Reference

> Read for expressions, functions, constants, interpolation, or version-gated syntax. Prefer the installed manual:
> `just --help`, `just --man`, or the current online manual.

Evaluate shell work only when Just cannot express it directly. For the collection-versus-string distinction, see
[settings.md](settings.md).

Place `set minimum-version` at the very top, before features it guards. The check runs in the parser; incompatible lexer
syntax can still fail before that check. Confirm the feature's introduction version and choose compatible syntax or
raise the repository's minimum version. See the
[minimum-version manual](https://just.systems/man/en/requiring-a-minimum-just-version.html).
